## 📖 Project Overview

**Quil & Byte Book Library** is a small, static website designed for the SNW project.
It uses **only HTML and CSS** for structure and styling.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

* Page layout and structure
* Responsive design (for *Popular*, *Review*, and *Favorite* sections)
* Basic UI components such as:

  * Navigation bar
  * Search bar
  * Content cards and grid layouts

---

## 💻 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Divyatmaj/SNW-Project-Website.git
   cd SNW-Project-Website
   ```

2. **Open the project**

   * Simply open `index.html` in any browser
     *or*
   * Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code for a better development experience

> ⚡ No build step is required — it’s a purely static site.

## 🎨 Styles and Assets

* **style.css** — global styles (typography, colors, layout, etc.)
* **popular.css**, **login.css** — page-specific overrides

  * You can merge these into `style.css` if you prefer a single stylesheet.
* **images/** — store all images here

  * Use **meaningful filenames**
  * Always include **alt text** for accessibility

---

✨ *Created with simplicity and clarity for the SNW Project.*

Would you like me to make it look a bit more **aesthetic and branded** (with a color header banner, emoji section titles, and contribution/license section) — or keep it **strictly professional** like this?
